        <p>As a psychology undergraduate student at Concordia University, I have had the privilege to
            study the
            fundamental facets of human emotion,cognition and behavior. With this in mind, the undergraduate program has
            also given me opportunities to pursue my learning more actively and get involved with the mental health
            community in innovative ways. Notably, I have had the opportunity to directly apply my knowledge at the
            provincial psychology case competitions as both a contender and eventually as a coach for Concordia’s
            neuroscience team. Within the 2018-2019 academic year, I had the honor to be elected as the finance
            coordinator for the Concordia Undergraduate Psychology Association. Along with my team, I have organized
            academic workshops, networking events and charity campaigns. These experiences provided me with
            opportunities to enhance my theoretical knowledge and have exposed me to the basis of public relations,
            event planning and financial management.

            Nowadays, I am currently completing an associates diploma in social media marketing while also applying for
            grad school for this upcoming in Buisiness Administration.

            <p>Outside of academics, I have had the good fortune to expand my skill set outside of undergraduate field.
                Over the course of summer 2019, I have had the honor to teach english as a second
                language at the Bouchereau Lingua International in Montreal. Throughout my time, I taught children from
                the ages of ten to sixteen and from a variety of nationalities. Prior to teaching, I also had the
                privilege to work for a canadian youth tourism company called ILOVETRAVEL. Throughout two summers, I was
                able to work abroad as trip leader in the Domincan Republic and as an airport coordinator in
                montreal.Given these experiences, I was able to further hone my communication and organizational skills
                in a creative manner.</p>
